### Hey, I'm Kedasha! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about making AI accessible to developers and helping underrepresented folks thrive in tech. I've keynoted alongside tech CEOs, reached 10M+ developers globally, and created frameworks that help developers turn their expertise into career acceleration. I currently work at GitHub as a Developer Advocate.

> I believe AI should amplify human potential, not replace it. Let's build the future where developers thrive alongside AI.

ðŸŽ¯ **What I Do**

- **AI Education**: Scaling GitHub Copilot adoption and teaching developers to build with AI
- **Developer Advocacy**: Creating content that reaches millions of developers worldwide
- **Framework Creation**: Built the C.O.D.E. Framework for strategic developer content creation
- **Community Building**: Supporting women and underrepresented developers in tech
- **Founder**: Created [VibeCodeHer Academy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vibecodeher-academy/) to turn ideas into apps in 48 hours - no coding required
