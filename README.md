### Hey, I'm Kedasha! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about encouraging others to get in the industry. I enjoy community building, content creation and learning deeply about Javascript and Developer Advocacy.

I've been working as a Front-End Engineer for the past two years and is currently learning about cloud engineering and security. I'm brushing off my NodeJS skills so I can be an effective Developer Advocate in this space. 😄
